## ðŸ’¡ My Inspiration

Working closely with city officials and communities, I've experienced how digital tools simplify our communication. This fuelled my curiosity and led me to learn programming. I'm shaping a career that blends creativity, technology, and effective stakeholder communication.

## ðŸ’• Why I Love App Development

Developing apps allows me to bring ideas to life and create solutions that people can use on their phones. I believe in making technology accessible to everyone and enjoy crafting user-friendly experiences. 

## ðŸ”­ What I'm Learning Next 

- Statamic: I'm excited to delve into the world of CMS using Statamic. Creating elegant and headless set ups in combination with Next.js is my goal.
